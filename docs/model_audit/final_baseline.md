# TOOFAN — Final Baseline Freeze and Improvement Readiness Audit

**Phase 12 · 2026-09-12 · branch `main` · HEAD `c6a8db9` (Phases 0–11 applied, uncommitted)**

> This is the authoritative pre-improvement snapshot of the TOOFAN repository.
> Every future ML/model change is to be measured against this document and
> against the numbers frozen here. Nothing below was retrained, tuned, or
> re-derived beyond reproduction of values that were already in the repo.

---

## 1. Executive summary

TOOFAN is a North-Indian-Ocean tropical cyclone analysis and forecasting suite
with 9 scientific branches, a pipeline orchestrator, a hazard engine, an API
layer, and a React dashboard.

At Phase 12 the repository is **test-clean (206/206)**, the frontend builds and
typechecks, and the audited scientific statuses now survive from the adapters
through the orchestrator to serialized output and the UI (Phases 10–11). The
repository is **ready to begin scientifically controlled ML improvement work**.
It is **NOT production-ready**: of 9 branches, only a small number run with real
artifacts today (genesis, trajectory, RI-IMD, recurvature); none is fully
scientifically validated; several branches have no reproducible training data or
artifact at all.

### Headline statuses (runtime, verified 2026-09-12)

| Branch | Runtime status (real adapter, real state) |
|---|---|
| Genesis | Prediction produced (real LightGBM pipeline) — prototype, inputs highly imputed |
| Trajectory | `LIMITED/UNVERIFIED` — real point forecasts; uncertainty saturated ~209.9 km |
| Intensity | `UNAVAILABLE` — no trained artifact or dataset in repo |
| RI | `AVAILABLE` IMD-only — real XGB branch; confidence fixed heuristic 0.55 |
| Recurvature | FAILED on minimal state (real model refuses incomplete input); real prediction when track history supplied |
| Rainfall | `AVAILABLE_BASELINE` — same-time classifier, not a forecast |
| Wind | `UNAVAILABLE` — TensorFlow import hard-aborts in current env |
| Flood | `DATA_UNAVAILABLE` — static spatial classifier needs grids/hydro preprocessing |
| Landslide | `STATIC_SUSCEPTIBILITY` — no ML artifact |
| Hazard engine | SUCCESS — returns honest `None` severity when nothing assessed |

- Python 3.13 (macOS arm64), pydantic v2 schema layer, PyTorch + XGBoost +
  LightGBM + scikit-learn + TensorFlow (broken) runtimes.
- `src/core/runtime.py::configure_runtime()` MUST run before any ML import:
  sets `OMP_NUM_THREADS=1` and pre-loads a single canonical `libomp` so PyTorch,
  XGBoost and LightGBM share one OpenMP runtime (avoids the native SIGSEGV/SIGABRT).
- Adapters live in `src/models/` (genesis, rainfall, wind, flood, landslide,
  adapters/* for trajectory/ri/intensity/recurvature).
- Frontend consumes API JSON through `frontend/src/services/toofanService.ts`;
  `dataMode` seam (`demo`/`live`) separates the frontend mock dataset
  (`frontend/src/data/mock/MOCK.ts`) from real API responses — mock data never
  enters backend inference.
- Config in `configs/pipeline.yaml`; model registry `models/registry/`.

## 5. Historical / unverified metrics

Explicitly marked. **Not reproduced from the current repository.** Do not combine
with Section 4. Do not use as a baseline without re-establishing it.

> `UNVERIFIED / HISTORICAL CLAIM — NOT REPRODUCED FROM CURRENT REPOSITORY`

| Model | Claimed metric | Where claimed | Reason not reproducible |
|---|---|---|---|
| Trajectory | median 24h error ~50–80 km | historical storm evaluation | no eval script/results for distilled artifact in repo |
| Intensity | 5-fold storm CV: MAE 14.55 kt, RMSE 19.66 kt, R² 0.037; exact 45.3% / within-1 84.0% | upstream intensity docs | artifact + dataset + results absent from repo |
| RI (IMD-only) | PR-AUC 0.594 > IMD+ERA5 0.341 (20 storms / 25 RI common test set) | RI report docs | strict common set construction not in repo |
| RI (satellite CNN) | OOF PR-AUC 0.516 (9 obs) | `cyclone_backup/README.md` §9d | OOF CSV absent; inference blockers (fold-0 scaler, unit mismatch) |
| RI (TCIR CNN) | PR-AUC 0.0917 / ROC 0.5782 (N=928 / 19 storms / 69 RI); dataset 2,840/64/189 | `cyclone_backup/README.md`, `SIH_FINAL_RI_REPORT.md` | TCIR dataset + results absent; artifact normalisation stats pathologically inf/nan |
| Flood | ROC-AUC 0.8025 (rain-only) / 0.9635 (rain+hydro) | `flood/metadata/flood_spatial_holdout_metadata.json` | exact 94-cell spatial holdout split not in repo; metrics reproduced from neither label scheme |
| Flood | near-100% "temporal validation" | `flood_xgboost_temporal_validation_predictions.csv` | file uses training-period timestamps + all cells + per-cell-constant labels — not a valid holdout |
| Genesis | 300-sample balanced dataset (150/150, 191 storms, 2015–2024) + any CV/test metrics | external source report | training data, script, metrics not in repo |
| Rainfall | two-stage regressor half of the "rainfall model" | upstream metadata | regressor artifact absent (`rain/model/rainfall_regressor_12.pkl` gitignored, non-existent) |
| Wind | (none claimed) | — | no numeric metrics anywhere for wind |

---

## 6. Known scientific limitations (frozen)

### Trajectory
- Real LT3P-distilled Transformer artifact; point forecast runs.
- Uncertainty head SATURATED at ~209.9 km (log-variance clamped +5): constant,
  NOT calibrated, NOT demonstrated to grow with lead time.
- Point-forecast skill is NOT currently re-verified against a baseline
  (persistence not computed).
- Synthetic/constructed runtime input history remains (12-point input path).

### Intensity
- No real trained artifact currently present; dataset absent.
- Historical ≈14.55 kt MAE is UNVERIFIED.
- A reproducible retraining recipe exists (`cyclone intensity/retrain.py`).
- No uncertainty (point-forecast regressor). Confidence, if the artifact were
  ever added, would be a documented 0.8/0.5 feature-completeness heuristic
  (flagged, see §8).

### RI
- IMD-only branch is the only reproducible, runtime branch.
- ERA5 runtime feature reconstruction unavailable (89-feature mismatch vs state).
- Satellite branch unavailable/unverified (fold-0 scaler absent, unit mismatch).
- Fusion meta-model absent — `fusion_probability` cannot be produced.

### Recurvature
- Real IBTrACS-based XGBoost model.
- ROC-AUC ≈0.722 / PR-AUC ≈0.522 are reproduced locally (in-repo) but the
  artifact and eval outputs are not in git.
- Calibration weak (Brier 0.2052, uncalibrated).
- Limited inference when history/features unavailable (placeholders).

### Genesis
- Real artifacts exist and run.
- Dataset/training provenance absent; scientific validation unreproducible.
- Runtime relies heavily on imputed/placeholder environmental inputs
  (synthetic SST/SST-anomaly/TCHP/OHC700).
- Prototype/unverified.

### Satellite (RI-adjacent)
- MERG-IR crops exist (26) but tiny sample size; 16/26 granules in repo.
- Satellite CNN artifact exists but inference preprocessing/scaler incomplete.
- TCIR results unreproducible (dataset absent; norm stats pathological).
- No demonstrated multi-source satellite fusion anywhere.

### Rainfall
- Same-time classification, NOT a future rainfall forecast.

### Wind
- Non-runnable case study (Yaas); TensorFlow runtime issue in current env; no
  valid operational pipeline; horizon undocumented.

### Flood
- Static/single-event spatial classifier; NOT a future flood forecast.
- Event-label leakage limitation documented (whole-event label leak).

### Landslide
- Static hazard/susceptibility maps only; no ML artifact.

## 7. Integration status

Verified by running each real adapter on a real `CycloneState` and by the
Phase 11 end-to-end propagation tests.

| Integration element | Status |
|---|---|
| Adapter statuses → orchestrator execution results | ✅ Phase 11 (`unavailable_statuses` set downgrades UNAVAILABLE-class outputs; LIMITED/UNVERIFIED/BASELINE kept as real SUCCESS) |
| Status survival through JSON serialization | ✅ Phase 11 tests |
| Status survival into frontend UI | ✅ Phase 11 (RiskPage, DashboardPage, ModelsPage, IntensityPage, FloodPage, HazardsPage, RecurvaturePage, CycloneMap, TrackPage) |
| Full DAG with real adapters + real data ingestion | ❌ NOT runnable end-to-end: `create_orchestrator(configs/pipeline.yaml)` fails to build a working `state_builder` (abstract `ERA5Loader`, missing IMD `.xlsx`) |
| DAG execution order + dependency gating | ✅ tested (orchestrator tests, Phase 11 full-DAG propagation) |
| Hazard engine | ✅ SUCCESS; honest `None` severity when nothing assessed |
| Recurvature in DAG | ⚠️ real adapter refuses incomplete state → orchestrator FAILED (honest, but blocks downstream) |

---

## 8. Fabricated-path audit (step 8 — search for hidden fabrication)

Search completed across `src/`. **No hard-coded predictions, no randomized
fallback predictions, no silent missing→zero conversions, no backend mock data.**
`missing→0` conversions reviewed: only legitimate physical zero/empty outputs on
UNAVAILABLE paths (`confidence=0.0`, empty grids) with a status field.

Documented (not hidden) heuristics — reported confidence values that are NOT
calibrated model outputs. These are the remaining "questionable" values, all
explicitly labeled in code:

| Location | Value | Nature |
|---|---|---|
| `src/models/adapters/ri_adapter.py:266` | `confidence = 0.55` (IMD branch ran) | Fixed heuristic; `calibrated_probability` is an alias for `imd_probability` — no applied calibration |
| `src/models/adapters/intensity_adapter.py:234` | `confidence = 0.8 if has_era5 else 0.5` | Feature-completeness heuristic; DEAD CODE today (artifact missing); documented "NOT a calibrated confidence" |
| `src/models/adapters/recurvature_adapter.py:247` | `conf = 0.95 − placeholder penalties` (min 0.25/max 1.0) | Penalized heuristic reflecting placeholder inputs; documented |
| `src/models/adapters/trajectory_adapter.py:198-216` | cross-horizon consistency cosine similarity; `0.5` fallback for <2 points | Deterministic motion-consistency heuristic (not calibration); documented |
| `src/models/genesis/adapter.py:602` | `confidence = clip(0.5 + |prob−0.24|, 0.5, 0.95)` | Margin heuristic; documented as "not a calibration" |

These are recorded in the baseline so future work can either remove them or
replace them with calibrated uncertainty. **Not modified in Phase 12** (no
model-behavior changes permitted outside the TrackPage fix).

Also flagged: `src/core/ingestion.py` contains abstract loaders (`ERA5Loader`
without `load`) — part of the end-to-end ingestion gap (see §7/§9); genesis
inputs imputed with median; recurvature `DIST2LAND`/`dir_change_3h/9h` are
placeholders when no track history is supplied.

---

## 9. Artifact readiness (step 9 — reproducibility)

Full inventory performed (paths, formats, sizes, git status). Summary:

| Branch | Artifact | Format | On disk | In git | Reproducible from fresh checkout? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Genesis | 3 approved joblib pipelines (LightGBM/XGB/RF) + imputer | joblib | ✅ | ✅ tracked | ✅ yes (retrain data absent, but artifact ships) |
| Trajectory | `best_cyclone_model_lt3p_distilled.pth` + `scalers.pkl` | PyTorch | ✅ | ✅ tracked | ✅ yes |
| Intensity | `final_xgb_regressor.joblib` | joblib | ❌ absent | ❌ | ❌ requires retrain w/ real dataset |
| RI-IMD | `imd_final_xgboost.json` (+ ERA5/combined XGB, sat `.pt`, TCIR bundle) | XGB JSON / PyTorch / Keras | ✅ all present | ✅ tracked | ✅ artifacts ship; satellite inference blocked by ABSENT `cyclone_backup/results/cnn_tabular_scaler.json` |
| Recurvature | `xgb_recurve_model.json` | XGB JSON | ✅ | ❌ **GITIGNORED** (`.gitignore:14`) | ❌ NOT reproducible; training CSVs gitignored/absent; in-repo eval CSV untracked |
| Rainfall | `rainfall_classifier_12.pkl` | joblib (RF) | ✅ | ✅ tracked | ✅ yes (metrics verticality reproducible from result CSVs) |
| Wind | `wind_model_best.keras` | Keras | ✅ | ✅ tracked | ✅ file ships, but NOT loadable (TF SIGABRT) |
| Flood | `flood_xgboost_spatial_holdout.pkl` | joblib (XGB) | ✅ | ✅ tracked | ✅ file ships; metrics + holdout split NOT reproducible |
| Landslide | none | — | — | — | n/a |

### Git-tracking facts
- All trained artifacts are tracked EXCEPT `recurvature/xgb_recurve_model.json`
  (`.gitignore:14`), `feature_importance.json` (`.gitignore:13`),
  `recurvature/results.csv` (`.gitignore:12`), and `recurvature/data/*.csv`
  (`.gitignore:31`, only `.gitkeep` present).
- `.gitignore` also ignores `*.h5`, `*.nc`, `*.npy`, `*.zip`, `data/*.csv`,
  `rain/model/rainfall_regressor_12.pkl` — but the tracked `.nc`/`.npy`/`.zip`
  files already in the index ARE reproducible from a fresh clone.
- Locally generated, untracked, NON-reproducible: `recurvature/test_predictions.csv`,
  `recurvature/model_metadata.json`, `frontend/dist/assets/index-*.js`
  (build artifact), `frontend/tsconfig.tsbuildinfo`, `metadata_clean.csv.bak`.
- Working-tree modified `M` tracked files (uncommitted Phase 0–11 changes):
  `recurvature/scaler.joblib`, `cyclone_backup/satellite_cnn_recovered/metadata_clean.csv`,
  docs, READMEs, all frontend source touched across Phases.

### Required for fresh-checkout reproducibility
1. **Archive the recurvature model externally** (or un-ignore and commit) + its
   training CSVs; otherwise retrain from a rebuilt IBTrACS dataset.
2. **Retrain intensity** from the real IMD/ERA5 dataset via
   `cyclone intensity/retrain.py`.
3. **Recover the satellite fold-0 scaler** (`results/cnn_tabular_scaler.json`)
   to make `satellite_cnn.pt` inferable.
4. **Provide a working TensorFlow runtime + input geometry** for wind.

Per Phase 12 rules, large artifacts were NOT committed just to make the report
look complete; the gaps above are documented instead.

## 10. Ranked improvement opportunities (roadmap — NOT implemented)

Ranking by scientific value × feasibility × data availability × objective
evaluability. This is the input to the next (improvement) phase.

| # | Target | Required data | Target model/piece | Baseline to beat | Evaluation | Expected difficulty | Current blocker |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Trajectory — real history + proper uncertainty** | IBTrACS (present) + operational real-time track history | rebuilt uncertainty head / recalibrated sigma; real history path | persistence; current saturated ~209.9 km band | ADE, FDE, per-horizon error; calibration metrics (reliability/CRPS) | Medium | synthetic/constructed runtime input history; no re-verified point baseline |
| 2 | **Recurvature — improve/calibrate the existing model** | IBTrACS (present; training CSVs rebuildable) | existing XGBoost + isotonic calibration + optional feature additions | ROC-AUC 0.7218 / PR-AUC 0.5218 / Brier 0.2052 | ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, F1, Brier, calibration curve | Low–medium | artifact gitignored (archival), placeholder inputs |
| 3 | **Intensity — real IMD/ERA5 dataset + genuine 24h model** | IMD best-track 1982–2026 (`IMD_best_track.xlsx` MISSING) + ERA5 (CDS) | retrain `retrain.py` recipe with verified split | persistence; climatology (R² currently ~0.04 historical baseline) | MAE, RMSE, R², per-lead | Medium | dataset/credentials; artifact absent |
| 4 | **RI — reconstruct ERA5 + satellite + genuine fusion** | ERA5 features (partial present), MERG-IR (16/26 granules; external NOMADS for rest), satellite scaler recovery | ERA5 feature reconstruction; fix fold-0 scaler; train fusion meta-model | IMD-only (PR-AUC 0.594 historical) | PR-AUC, recall, precision, Brier/calibration | Medium–high | ERA5 runtime wiring; satellite scaler; TCIR dataset absent |
| 5 | **Genesis — real environmental dataset + verified labels** | real (non-synthetic) SST/SST-anomaly/TCHP/OHC700 fields + genesis labels | re-train/validate LightGBM production path on verified data | median-imputed prototype (baseline TBD) | PR-AUC, ROC-AUC, recall, FPR, calibration, prevalence baseline | High | training data/provenance absent; external source needed |
| 6 | **Satellite — expand tiny dataset + fix preprocessing** | more MERG-IR granules + labels (external; ~10 granules missing from repo) | fix `normalize_patch` units; rebuild scaler; retrain CNN; reproduce OOF | UNVERIFIED (currently none reproducible) | PR-AUC, ROC-AUC | High | dataset size (26 crops), external downloads, TF env for Keras path |
| 7 | **Hazard branches → genuine future predictions where data permits** | multi-event IMERG (rainfall), gridded ERA5 (wind), dynamic lead labels + label-scheme fix (flood), landslide inventory (landslide) | redefine tasks with lead-time targets; proper temporal splits; real dynamic inference | current same-time/static baselines | branch-appropriate (define per task, see §11) | High | rainfall/wind/flood data breadth; wind TF env; flood label leak must be removed |

---

## 11. Objective improvement criteria

**Rules:** no invented targets like "90% accuracy"; always compare against the
appropriate baseline; hold out by storm; report uncertainty calibration when a
new uncertainty is built.

| Branch | Comparing against | Metrics |
|---|---|---|
| Trajectory | persistence; appropriate kinematic baseline | ADE, FDE, per-horizon error; calibration (reliability, CRPS) if uncertainty is rebuilt |
| Intensity | persistence; climatological baseline | MAE, RMSE, R² (where appropriate), per-lead performance |
| RI | IMD-only vs ERA5 vs satellite vs fusion | PR-AUC, recall, precision, Brier/calibration |
| Recurvature | current reproduced baseline (0.722/0.522) and uncalibrated Brier | ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, F1, calibration, baseline comparison |
| Genesis | prevalence baseline (5.6% BoB) and median-imputed prototype | PR-AUC, ROC-AUC, recall, false-positive rate, calibration, prevalence baseline |
| Rainfall (future task) | persistence of current rainfall; same-time baseline | to be defined only after the future-cast task is specified |
| Wind | persistence of wind field | to be defined (requires runnable pipeline + documented horizon first) |
| Flood | static spatial baseline; dynamic task must fix label leak first | to be defined after task redefinition |
| Landslide | none yet (no model) | task definition required first |

---

## 12. Known blockers

1. **Full end-to-end pipeline not runnable with real ingest**: `create_orchestrator`
   needs a working `state_builder`; `DataIngestionLayer` has abstract loaders
   (`ERA5Loader`) and referenced data files are missing (`IMD_best_track.xlsx`,
   `dem.tif`, soil/landcover/hydro paths). DAG is exercised via controlled
   adapters in tests only.
2. **Recurvature reproducibility**: model + training data not in git.
3. **Intensity**: artifact + dataset absent; ECMWF CDS credentials needed for ERA5.
4. **Satellite**: fold-0 scaler absent; Kelvin↔[0,1] unit mismatch; MERG-IR
   download needs external NOMADS; TCIR dataset absent; TF environment broken.
5. **Wind**: TensorFlow import SIGABRT; no input geometry documented; no pipeline.
6. **Flood labels**: whole-event label leak + disagreeing label schemes (70 vs 3)
   must be resolved before a dynamic flood product.
7. **Genesis data**: no training dataset in repo; synthetic env features.
8. **TensorFlow ecosystem** entirely non-runnable in the current environment.

## Final verdict

> **Is TOOFAN now ready to enter an ML improvement phase? — YES.**

Reasoning:
- ✅ repository is test-clean (206/206), frontend typechecks and builds;
- ✅ statuses are honest and survive adapter → orchestrator → serialization → UI;
- ✅ fabricated outputs removed (Phases 10–11) and remaining uncalibrated
  confidence heuristics are documented (not hidden);
- ✅ major scientific limitations are recorded above and were not softened;
- ✅ verified metrics are separated from historical/unverified claims;
- ✅ data blockers are known and tabulated.

This does **NOT** mean the models are production-ready. It means the project is
ready to begin scientifically controlled improvement work, starting with the
priorities in §10, measured against the frozen baselines in §4.
